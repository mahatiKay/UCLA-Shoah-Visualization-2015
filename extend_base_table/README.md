##Getting Started

- Extract the 2015 thesaurus and segment-keywords XML zips to the ../data folder. 
- Change the 'config.py' file in ./common to reflect the database to write the 
Testimonies, Thesaurus and the SegmentKeywords tables to and a username and password combination to access it. 
- **query.py** - Please use 'python query -h' for more information on the arguments to use to execute it right.
